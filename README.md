this is just for recording. 

I want to learn python since 2020, but at that time i barely have time. Or just not the good timing.

But now, after using youtube-dl, i think i'm ready to learn python.
And i really appreaite that @friscojosh recommend learnenough.com, so i have learned the command line and now git.
